    """ The BlockchainMonitor Class is used to listen to the BitShares blockchain
        and react on transfers to the monitored account (as per the configuration)

        :param bitshares.bitshares.BitShares bitshares_instance: (optional)
            Instance of ``Bitshares()``. Uses pybitshares internal
            configuration as default
        :param int start_block: First block to look at
        :param int last_block: Last block to look at

        When instantiating, the object

        1. obtains a storage object from the factory
        2. obtains data about the exchange account name from the blockchain

        .. note:: This object requires that either WIF keys for the memo
            decoding are manually provided through ``bitshares_instance``, or
            that the BitShares wallet is unlocked with a passphrase using the
            `.unlock_wallet(pwd)` method.

        An object, when listening (see below) will parse all blocks, with all
        transactions, with all operations and only post-process those that
        match our criteria (e.g. transfers from or to the exchange account).
        Post processing, by default, calls the storage and inserts the
        operation.
