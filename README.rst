Short ReadMe
============

Please find the full documentation at https://blockchainbv.github.io/bexi/

Bexi is written in python and enables the integration of BitShares into an external exchange. The basic idea is that
the external exchange will have one BitShares account to consolidate the funds that it holds for  
the customers. Deposits and withdrawals into and from said account is tracked and the customer balance
calculated.

Nevertheless, this module is not meant to be an accounting platform for the external exchange, it is merely
the technical realization of the integration.

Supported exchanges
-------------------------------

This software was motivated and constructed for the implementation of the Lykke exchange. Thanks to Lykke
it is available as open source (for licensing information please see LICENSE.rst file).
If you operate your own exchange and wish to integrate BitShares, feel free to contact info@blockchainprojectsbv.com.

This library was implemented according to

Quick Guide
-------------------------------
Fill in the operation storage details, 
as well as the BitShares exchange account and connection
details in the config yaml files.
The manage_service and blockchain_monitor require the memo key of the 
exchange account, whereas the sign_service requires only the active key.
The active key is what you normally see as the private key, since it allows
to move funds, whereas the memo key only allows reading the memo message of
transfers. 

Start the blockchain monitor service (isalive wsgi response with the actual monitor as coroutine, needs chain connection)

.. code-block:: bash

	$ python3 cli.py blockchain_monitor_service

Start the sign service (create wallets, sign transactions, offline)

.. code-block:: bash

	$ python3 cli.py sign_service
  
and the manage service (buil and broadcast transactions, manage balances, history, ..., needs chain connection)

.. code-block:: bash

	$ python3 cli.py manage_service
